    <h2>About the Project:</h2>
    <br>
    <p>eBuddy is a social networking app that focuses on helping people who struggle to find the right person, to do the right thing, at the right time to establish genuine and meaningful social connections with others who share the same interests and passions with them from a virtual world to real life.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>Role & Responsibilities:</strong> As one of the main UX designers, I have been involved in all phases of the project. Main responsibilities were conducting one-on-one semi-structured user interviews, illustrating design ideas and prototyping.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 weeks</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>Methods:</strong> User Interview, Persona Creation, Wireframes, Prototyping</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Adobe XD, Miro, Zoom</p>

    <p>We conducted <strong>5 one-on-one semi-structured</strong>user interviews over Zoom and surveys on Google Forms and Facebook to acquire a broader range of responses. </p>

    <p><strong>The key findings derived from the interviews and surveys:</strong></p>

            <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
            <p>Based on the user interview and survey insights, our team had some initial ideas for the eBuddy app. Our next step was to turn to the competition and see how we perform compared to other social networking apps. <br>
                <br>
                From our analysis, it was evident how our competitors allow their users to <strong>create user profiles</strong> and <strong>login/sign up</strong>within the app. These and other features allow us to take into consideration for our design concepts.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <br>
    <p>ebuddy is designed to help mentally exhausted active social media users effectively and efficiently connect to people who share commonalities such as similar interests or passions with them since we have observed that people have spent a lot of time and effort struggling to search for specific interest matches online. </p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>How might we shorten the process in connecting people who share similar interests, passions or goals so that they can save time and mental effort finding compatible connections online? </strong></p>

    <h2>User Persona:</h2>

    <p>Based on the research results, the main persona was identified:</p>

    <p>A storyboard was drawn to visualize a user’s journey when getting to use the eBuddy app. </p>

    <h2>Low Fidelity Wireframes:</h2>
    <br>
    <p>We created low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes using Adobe XD to brainstorm and test the initial design ideas.</p>

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We created a test plan for users to complete consecutive tasks on the high-fidelity prototype. </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>5 users, 4 tasks </li>
                <li>100% success rate </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p><strong>We gained following insights:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two participants struggled a bit to find the match button</li>
                <li>One participant commented the heart icon did not signify if they are likes options for a specific feature or to match with someone</li>
                <li>Two participants clicked the setting icon instead of editing profile to verify the account. </li>

    <ul>
        <li>Teamwork is the key to success. Since this project requires three teammates to work together and build a clickable mobile app prototype from the beginning, it is really important to communicate with teammates and distribute the workload based on each person’s speciality and availability. Bad teamwork will significantly affect the project progress and final outcomes.  </li>
        <li>Good time management also plays an important role in the group project. Since we only have three weeks to develop a clickable prototype from scratch, every class we have to ensure we complete the designated tasks on time. Otherwise, the number of tasks we need to complete will accumulate and become overwhelming . We have used tools like Trello and Google calendar to help us get on top of tasks and manage each person’s time better. </li>
